This study aims to compare classical machine learning (ML) models (random decision forest, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN)) to deep learning (DL) models (BERT) for text classification. We compared models by training and testing each model on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and evaluating performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. BERT performed better than the other models on all metrics, but this required greater computational resources. Use of classical versus DL and ML models for classification depends on the nature of the task. (see attached pdf)
